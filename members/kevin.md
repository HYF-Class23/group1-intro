I left many things behind when I left my country but one of the most important
ones, was my family.

In belgium being polyglot is quite a thing. So here is a breakdown of my
languages skills:

│---------│------------│  
│English  │Advanced    │  
│Spanish  │Advanced    │  
│French   │Beginner    │

Wrapping up, I see myself as resilient and hard-working individual. Hence, I am
pretty confident that I'll accomplish the below goals by end of this year:

- [x] Complete the full stack developer course
- [x] Starting looking for a job in web-development
- [x] Land a job

Thanks for reading!
